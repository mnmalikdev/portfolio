          "I am thrilled to include my work on the home gym partner project in my software developer portfolio. As part of the development team at my organization, I was given the opportunity to work on this exciting project from start to finish.The home gym partner platform consists of an intuitive admin panel for trainers and coaches, enabling them to easily add workouts, music, and schedule gym sessions. On the client side, the app features a webRTC module implemented with daily.co API, allowing clients to join in on gym sessions through convenient video conference calls. Unfortunately, due to an NDA I have signed, I am unable to share the project link or github repository. However, I am confident that my work on this project speaks for itself and demonstrates my ability to create user-friendly and innovative solutions.",
